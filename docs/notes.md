## Project Ideas

1. **A Real-Time Game App**
   Do you have a burning idea for a game that you've passionately pursued full-stack development to achieve? The time is now. To qualify as a game, your project should:
   Support user accounts and user data through a databaseProvide some interactivity or gameplay elementsHave clear goals or provide some state of "winning" or "losing"Provide a profit model, either through subscription or in-app purchasesOperate both as a desktop application and a mobile application
2. **Workout Tracker App**
   Tracking workouts or exercises puts an interesting spin on a regular scheduling app. You can do this with any type of recurring hobby. Develop an app that will:
   Support user accounts and customization with authenticationSchedule workouts/hobbies and reschedule missed sessionsLet users determine the frequency and preferred scheduling of their workoutsConnect users through support groups and competitive teamsIntelligently send users reminders and alerts
3. **Video Calling App**
   Video is now ubiquitous. But just ten years ago, video calling was exhausting. Think about how you could make the process of video calling easier. Create a video calling app that can:
   Let users log in to their accounts and connect with those on their contact list.Support multiple users within the same video conferencing room.Store video calls, on request, for reference later.Support one-on-one calls scheduled between users.Provide additional features such as text chats.
4. **Image Sharing App**
   You've seen Instagram and Imgur. It's time to make your own image-sharing app. Image sharing isn't just popular; there are a lot of potential niches to fill.Â 
   An image sharing app:
   Let users upload, store, and manage images. Provide filters so users can update and edit their imagesCompress images intelligently for better performanceAutomatically prune unused images of abandoned imagesLets users pay for more space on or other premium features
5. **Collaborative Editing App**
   This full-stack project tests whether you're ready to create a real-time application. A collaborative editing app will need to:
   Support multiple users in a single room editing a fileAlert users if they are trying to edit something someone else has edited. Combine edits intelligently or lock files when they are being editedProvide easy roll-backs to prior versions of a file. Authenticate users and support multiple permission types (such as viewer and editor).
